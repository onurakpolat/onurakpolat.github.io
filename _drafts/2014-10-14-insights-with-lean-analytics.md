I remember stopped working in consulting because all i created was concepts and slides. The truth is, i was a powerpoint bitch.
When i started to work with large amounts of data, naturally the first thing i did was a lot of descriptive data analysis and visualization. I was hired as an analyst and became a reporting bitch quite soon. Don't get me wrong - there was lots of things to do and i learned a lot, it just didn't feel right...

In this post i'll share my expierences in the last two years of how to do the transition from a data analyst to a data scientist and to generate insights that actually matter. The areas i'll touch are settings the goals, building a team, structures and culture, building a technical infrastructure, defining a lean process, Choosing the right metrics and making predictions. It's a lot to cover and i'll keep it as short as possible.

While reading i'd appreciated your feedback and feel free to challenge every single word i'm writing (but be nice :D).

## Setting the goals

Everything you do should have an explicit goal before you start. Write it down, communicate and approve it, then start the planning. To me the three most important goals for an Insights team are:

##### Identify the "real" problems

> What problem are you trying to solve?

is the single first question you should ask. Often there are different people requesting some analysis without knowing which problem they are actualy trying to solve. If there is one thing to remember from this post - it should be this.

##### Define and validate hypothesis

Another goal shoul be the validation of hypothesis. This only works if you define hypothesis in the first place. I'll explain that part more detailed in the [defining a lean process](#defining-a-lean-process) section. A simple product hypothesis could be something like:

> If we change the call to action for our signup from "Signup" to "Get fucking started" we increase the signup rate (conversion) from 3% to 5%.

The rest is specifying the success metric further, designing the experiment (A/B test) and tracking the hell out of it.

##### Ingest data in the companies DNA
