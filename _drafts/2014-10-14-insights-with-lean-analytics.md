I remember stopped working in consulting because all i created was concepts and slides. The truth is, i was a powerpoint bitch.
When i started to work with large amounts of data, naturally the first thing i did was a lot of descriptive data analysis and visualization. I was hired as an analyst and became a reporting bitch quite soon. Don't get me wrong - there was lots of things to do and i learned a lot, it just didn't feel right...

In this post i'll share my expierences in the last two years of how to do the transition from a data analyst to a data scientist and to generate insights that actually matter. The areas i'll touch are settings the goals, building a team, structures and culture, building a technical infrastructure, defining a lean process, Choosing the right metrics and making predictions. It's a lot to cover and i'll keep it as short as possible.

While reading i'd appreciated your feedback and feel free to challenge every single word i'm writing (but be nice :D).

## Setting the goals

It should be clear that everything you should have an explicit goal before you start. Write it down, communicate and approve it, then start the planning. To me the most important goals when working with data are:

### Identify the "real" problems
> What problem are you trying to solve?

Should be the single first question you should ask. Often there are different people requesting some analysis without knowing which problem they are actualy trying to solve. If there is one thing to remember from this post - it should be this.

###### Define and validate hypothesis
###### Ingest data in the companies DNA

## Building a team, structures and cuture

## Building a technical infrastructure

## Defining a lean process

## Choosing the right metrics

## Making predictions
