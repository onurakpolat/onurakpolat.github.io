I remember stopped working in consulting because all i created was concepts and slides. The truth is, i was a powerpoint bitch.
When i started to work with large amounts of data, naturally the first thing i did was a lot of descriptive data analysis and visualization. I was hired as an analyst in a startup and became a reporting bitch soon. Was that the hands-on work i expected from working in a young startup? It just didn't feel right, so i decided to make a change.

In this post i'll share my expierences of the last two years on building an insights team in a startup and how we did the transition from data analysts to data scientists to generate actionable insights that matter. The areas i'll touch are [setting the goals](#setting-the-goals), [building a team, structures and culture](#building-a-team-structures-and-culture), [building a technical infrastructure](#building-a-technical-infrastructure), [defining a lean process](#defining-a-lean-process), [choosing the right metrics](#choosing-the-right-metrics) and [making predictions](#making-predictions).

While reading i'd appreciated your feedback and feel free to challenge every single word i'm writing.

## Setting the goals

Everything you do should have an explicit goal before you start. Write it down, communicate and approve it, then start the planning. To me the three most important goals for an Insights team are:

##### Identify the "real" problems

> What problem are you trying to solve?

is the single first question you should ask. Often there are different people requesting some analysis without knowing which problem they are actualy trying to solve. If there is one thing to remember from this post - it should be this.

##### Define and validate hypothesis

Once the real problems are identified it's important to transform vague questions into measurable hypothesis that can be validated. This only works if you define hypothesis in the first place. A simple product hypothesis could be something like:

> If we change the call to action for our signup from "Signup" to "Get fucking started" we increase the signup rate (conversion) from 3% to 5%.

The rest is specifying the success metric further, designing the experiment (A/B test) and tracking the hell out of it. I'll explain this part more detailed in the [defining a lean process](#defining-a-lean-process) section.

##### Ingest data in the companies DNA

Data informed thinking has to start with the CEO and go all the way through to every single engineer, otherwise you'll have a hard time fighting to help others. I didn't give this a single thought when i started but it turned out that half of my efforts ended up beeing educating others to think with data and eventually using tools to validate or falsify their initial hypothesis.

## Building a team, structures and culture

As the first hire for data analysis i was lucky enough to have full control on how to scope and design the insights team and structure. Depanding on what the expectations of your role are you should define the responsibilies and tasks. This is what we came up with:

## Building a technical infrastructure

## Defining a lean process

## Choosing the right metrics

## Making predictions

## Where to go from here?
