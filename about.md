title: About
---

I built and led the insights team at [Onefootball](http://onefootball.com/)
for almost two years. I have always been fascinated by technology
and especially tools for analysing and interpreting data.

My vision is boundless freedom and to be a unicorn.
Thats why i'm interested in building products and everything related to
engineering & data, design & ux as well as the business world.

Before working at Onefootball, i was in the core team of a startup (which failed),
worked at [Delivery Hero](http://deliveryhero.com/) and worked in different consultancies
as a student. I studied computer science & business in Berlin and Brisbane.
